	      Methods help you modularize a program by separating its tasks into self-contained units.

	      Pros:
	      - Written only once â€“ no repeated code
	      - Methods can be reused (invoked, called) from several locations in a program
	      - Divide and conquer approach - Constructing programs from small, simple pieces
	      - Software reusability - Use existing methods/classes as building blocks to create new programs.
	      - Dividing a program into meaningful methods/classes makes the program easier to debug and maintain.
